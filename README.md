Seen different choices of image resolution and w/h ratio so far, some use squares, some rectangles. Conducted this analysis to learn more about the images given, especially after they are cropped. Note that image width and height are swapped if height > width, for original versions as well as cropped versions.

In the end you can find a summary with the fractions of images that need to be 'shrinked' after cropping for different input resolutions together with the mean 'shrink factor' and more statistics for each resolution. In this summary width / height ratios of around 2 seems to work best.
